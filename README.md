## Philosophy
  - Embrace open source (OS)
  - OS operating systems are authentic control of hardware, the only true way to claim ownership of data.
  - OS networking, tor, enables connection without intermediaries able to tell the origin or the destination, the only true way to get online privacy.
  - OS money, bitcoin, cannot be counterfeited even by its creator or operators.
  - OS social, ao, hopefully the first of many.

barriers are low,
implications profound,
no time like now!?

## Intent
- connect inside new perspective [[ยน]](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=inside+the+computer+zoolander+clip&t=canonical&ia=web)

- setup and control local hardware with pi pin integration
