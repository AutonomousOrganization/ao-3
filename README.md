### ao towards autonomous organization

Our choices now will create the new characteristics of human power and will determine if the semiconductor ultimately realized or destroyed liberty.  

Social interaction on Facebook's computers, financial interaction on bank computers, website interactions on Amazon's computers: who controls the computer collects the power. As a society we need to take away the great aggregation of power that has happened by conveniently using centralized services.  

As well as physically controlling the computer a computer is only really yours if you **can** know everything the software on it is doing. From the operating system up it must be open source.  

There is a limited capacity for everything and our default state is complete ignorance. Modern free markets were efficient mechanisms for progress because prices and profits were conduits of information. When free participants can react in real time to new information, whether they succeed or fail more information is created. Modern Monetary Theory has completely undermined money and markets. Political manipulation muddies the information conduit. It no longer possible to learn from our markets so society itself is in a downward spiral until we can free money from politics and salvage a our conduit of information.  

Bitcoin is a public money system. It is immune to political interference. It can revitalize capitalism and create markets that provide information again. Humanity needs only one public money system: Bitcoin is it. It gives direct access to a store of value, to an international market to everyone.   

AO is a Nodejs server. It is a shared notepad that can be used to collect notes, ideas, tasks and record when you have done the things that you want to do. It can be extended to control physical devices on the local network [(pi)](https://github.com/AutonomousOrganization/pi). It shows information about bitcoind and lightningd - a full bitcoin node and full lightning node that are uncompromising positive contributors to the ecosystem. Each note can receive payments to address and invoice into your lightning node.
