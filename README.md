### ao towards autonomous organization

Our choices now will create the new characteristics of human power and will determine if the semiconductor ultimately realized or destroyed liberty.  

Very simply the power goes to the entity in control of the computer. Social interaction on Zucky's computers concentrates power to him. Financial interaction on bank computers concentrates power to them. Take back your share of tech power by communicating using your own computer. You can only really say that a computer is yours if you can know everything the software on it is doing. From the operating system up it must be open source.  

There is a limited capacity for everything and our default state is complete ignorance about everything. Money and capitalism has created unprecedented wealth and efficiency because it functions as a conduit of information and autonomous actors can utilize that information. But globalization has completely coopted money with political manipulation, it no longer functions as a conduit of information. Systems that perpetuate wealth without creating value are unethical and ultimately *doomed*.  

Bitcoin is a public money system. It is immune to political interference. It can revitalize capitalism. It gives property rights, access to a store of value, access to an international market to anyone with a computer.
