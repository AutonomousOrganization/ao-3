ao is an example of using open source everything on hardware under your control. local data (sqlite3), private communication (tor), verified currency (bitcoind), instant transactions (lightningd), and checkmarktopia tying it all together - ao.

An install [folder](/install) contains scripts to install all of these and go from a fresh linux to a globally accessible ao.

Access via [tor browser](https://www.torproject.org/download/).

The political and financial establishment has shown great hubris. They believe they have control of the market. And they more or less did, until a new entrant - digital scarcity - a unit globally accessible, cryptographically secure, with public data. A verifiably impossible to debase unit, the smallest unit a satoshi after the anonymous creator's release of working code and a working network that was public, accessible, widely shared (as much as is possible when no one cares) from the very start. It is not going to end well for the established players of finance. And good riddence, democracy and civil rights will be more easily defended without that great ongoing transfer of power and wealth to the centers.
